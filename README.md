# Coin Flip Web game
A coin flip web game I put too much effort into. Why did I do this? Good question. I don't know either.

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

# Running
```python app.py```

# Running (for plebs)
Go to ```https://github.com/EvESpirit/coinflipwebgame/releases``` and download the latest .exe.
